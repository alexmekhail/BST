![BinarySearchTree](https://sarabostani-public.s3.amazonaws.com/ds-and-algo/img/bst.gif)
## Overview
In this assignment we are going to implement a Binary Search Tree class with the find, add, delete, multiple traversals, and other functionalities. The goal of this exercise is to familiarize yourself with the inner structure of a BST.
## Instructions
As usual, follow the comments in the source code and implement the code that is missing. If everything works correctly, you should be able to run `Main.java` and all tests should pass as well.

You can get partial credit for this exercise. Each test has some points assigned to it and the weight of points depends on the complexity of the algorithm.
